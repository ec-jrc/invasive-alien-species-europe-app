<p>The European Commission (hereafter ‘the Commission’) is committed to protect your personal data and to respect your privacy. The Commission collects and further processes personal data pursuant to <a href="#" ng-click="openExternalLinks($event,'https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R1725')">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data (repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001).
<br>This privacy statement explains the reason for the processing of your personal data, the way we collect, handle and ensure protection of all personal data provided, how that information is used and what rights you have in relation to your personal data. It also specifies the contact details of the responsible Data Controller with whom you may exercise your rights, the Data Protection Officer and the European Data Protection Supervisor.

<p class="sidemenu-modal-content-title">2. Why and how do we process your personal data?</p>
<p>Purpose of the processing operation: JRC.B.6 collects and uses your personal information to set up the Invasive Alien Species Europe App. This app enables the public to receive and share information about Invasive Alien Species (IAS) in Europe.
<br>It provides details about different IAS (number of species specified in EU Regulation 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species) that are considered to be of interest to the complete European Union.
<br>Users can record pictures of possible Invasive Alien Species together with complementary information about their observation. Once validated, data will be fed into the EASIN (European Alien Species Information Network) system.
<br>Your personal data will not be used for an automated decision-making including profiling.
